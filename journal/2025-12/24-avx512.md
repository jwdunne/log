# 2025-12-24: Batching / AVX512

## What I did

- Implemented memory mapping on my 1BRC solution
- Split the region into 3 chunks without overlap
- Interleaved the same operations on each chunk for ILP
- Used AVX512 in delimiter search and linear probing 

## What I learned

- AVX512 is similar to AVX2
- A SIMD algorithm on the right problem can be very fast and very simple
- Interleaving operations to encourage ILP is offset by increased branching
- Memory-mapped I/O was an extremely straightforward and quick performance win

## What next

- Parallelism and then I'm calling it good
